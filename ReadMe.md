# Bank Customer Churn Data Analysis

## Problem Statement

As a Data Analyst, I am tasked with addressing the bank’s growing concern over customer attrition. Despite having a large customer base, the bank lacks clarity on why certain customers choose to leave while others remain loyal. There is no existing data-driven framework to assess which demographics, financial behaviors, or engagement patterns contribute to churn. Without these insights, the bank risks making uninformed decisions that could lead to continued customer loss and missed opportunities for growth. This analysis aims to bridge that gap by exploring the underlying factors influencing customer behavior and churn.


## Objective

- Analyze this customer dataset to uncover valuable insights for the bank's decision-making process.

- focus on understanding the demographic

- Understanding financial characteristics of the bank's customers

- Identifying trends and patterns in customer engagement

- highlight potential areas for business improvement(e.g., customer retention or service optimization).


## Dataset

- Source: `Bank_Churn_Messy.xlsx`

- Sheets: Customer_Info & Account_Info

- Columns In Customer_Info: CustomerId, Surname, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, EstimatedSalary

- Columns In Account_Info: CustomerId, Balance, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, Tenure, IsActiveMember, Exited

- Merged on `CustomerId`


## Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
- Jupyter Notebook
- VS Code
- Git & GitHub


## Key Insights

- The overall churn rate is approximately XX%.

- Customers in [Geography] and aged [30–45] are more likely to churn.

- Inactive members and those with more products tend to churn more.

- Surprisingly, customers with higher balances and low credit scores also churn.


These insights can help the bank better target at-risk customers.


## Recommendations
-  Create retention programs targeting high-risk demographics.

- Reward active users to reduce inactivity churn.

- Conduct product satisfaction surveys for multi-product users.

- Educate customers on credit health to improve engagement.
